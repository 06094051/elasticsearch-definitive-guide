=== Phrase matching

In the same way that the `match` query is the ``go-to'' query for standard
full text search, the `match_phrase` query is the one you should reach for
when you want to find words that are near to each other:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /my_index/my_type/_search
{
    "query": {
        "match_phrase": {
            "title": "quick brown fox"
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

Like the `match` query, the `match_phrase` query first analyzes the query
string to produce a list of terms. It then searches for all the terms, but
only keeps documents  which contains *all* of the search terms in the same
*positions*, relative to each other.  A query for the phrase `"quick fox"`
would not match any of our documents because no document contains the word
`"quick"` immediately followed by `"fox"`.

==== Term positions

When a string is analyzed, the analyzer returns not only a list of terms, but
also the _position_ or order of each term in the original string:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_analyze?analyzer=standard
Quick brown fox
--------------------------------------------------

This returns:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
   "tokens": [
      {
         "token": "quick",
         "start_offset": 0,
         "end_offset": 5,
         "type": "<ALPHANUM>",
         "position": 1 <1>
      },
      {
         "token": "brown",
         "start_offset": 6,
         "end_offset": 11,
         "type": "<ALPHANUM>",
         "position": 2 <1>
      },
      {
         "token": "fox",
         "start_offset": 12,
         "end_offset": 15,
         "type": "<ALPHANUM>",
         "position": 3 <1>
      }
   ]
}
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `position` of each term in the original string.

Positions can be stored in the inverted index, and position-aware queries like
the `match_phrase` query can use them to match only documents which contains
all of the words in exactly the order specified, with no words inbetween.

==== What is a phrase

For a document to be considered a match for the phrase ``quick brown fox'':

* `quick`, `brown` and `fox` must all appear in the document

* the position of `brown` must be `1` greater than the position of `quick`

* the position of `fox` must be `2` greater than the position of `quick`

If any of these conditions is not met, the document is not considered a match.

==== Other queries

Phrase matching is also supported by the `query_string` and `field` queries,
where a phrase should be demarcated with double quotes:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /my_index/my_type/_search
{
    "query": {
        "query_string": {
            "query": "title:\"quick brown fox\""
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

**************************************************

Internally, the `match_phrase` and `query_string` queries use the low-level
`span` query family to do position-aware matching. Span queries are term-level
queries, so they have no analysis phase -- they search for the exact term
specified.

Thankfully, most people never need to use the `span` queries directly as the
`match_phrase` query is usually good enough. However, certain specialized
fields, like patent searches, use these low-level queries to perform very
specific carefully constructed positional searches.
