[[term_filter]]
==== Term filter

The most basic filter is the `term` filter, which asks: ``Does field `foo`
contain the exact value `bar`?''

For instance, does field `status` contain the string `"active"`:

    { "term": { "status": "active" }}

Does field `count` contain `5`:

    { "term": { "count": 5 }}

Does field `publish_date` contain the date `2012-01-01`:

    { "term": { "publish_date": "2012-01-01" }}

Term filters work for all simple data types (e.g. strings, numbers, dates).
They only match exact values: if you search for `active` but your field
contains `ACTIVE` then the term filter will not match.

[NOTE]
====
A term filter checks if the field *contains* the value, rather than if
the field is *equal to* the value, because a field might contain multiple
values.  For instance, an array of `tags`:

        { "tags": [ "elasticsearch", "lucene", "nosql" ]}
