[[null_values]]
=== Null values

A field can have zero or more values.  elasticsearch can't index
a `null` or undefined value. Instead, if a field is set to `null`, it
has zero values.

[[exists_filter]]
==== Exists filter

To check whether a field has a value, use the `exists` filter:

    { "exists": { "field": "field_name" }}

[[missing_filter]]
==== Missing filter

The inverse of the `exists` filter is the `missing` filter, which checks
whether the field has no values:

    { "missing": { "field": "field_name" }}

[NOTE]
=====
If you store an array of values, one of which is `null`, only the non-null
values will be indexed.  For instance:

    { count: [ 1, 3, null, 5] }

The field `count` would have the values 1, 3 and 5 indexed.
