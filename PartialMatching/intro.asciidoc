Partial matching is an enormously powerful tool.  A keen observer will notice that all the queries so far in this book have operated on whole terms.  To match something, the smallest "unit" had to be an exact term.

But what happens if you want to match parts of a term but not the whole thing? There are many reasons why you may only want to match parts of a word: perhaps there are mispellings or multiple spellings available, or you wish to implement "as-you-type" autocompletion.

Whatever the reason, Elasticsearch offers a number of ways to tackle the partial-matching problem.
