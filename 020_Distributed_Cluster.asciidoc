[[distributed-cluster]]
== Life inside a Cluster

.Supplemental Chapter
****
As mentioned earlier, this is the first of several "supplemental" chapters about
how Elasticsearch operates in a distributed environment.  It is useful and
interesting data, but feel free to skip it.  You can use Elasticsearch for
a long time without worrying about shards, replication and fallover.
