 -> unassigned, yellow
 > Start a second node
 -> replicas assigned, green
 -> failover
 > Start a third node
 -> Reallocation
 -> scale load
 > increase replicas
 -> more failover
 > kill master node
 -> new master

Scale:
 - start a second node
  -> replicas
    -> failover - always available
 - start a third node
  -> reallocation
    -> scale load
 - increase replicas
   -> more failover
 - kill master node



Always available
