== Facets â€“ real time analytics

Facets allow us to perform real-time analytics by grouping or aggregating big 
data. 

For instance, facets can be used to show totals-per-category, the most popular 
search terms, relevant tags to restrict searches, graphs of timelines or 
the number of results within a geographic range.  

This chapter explains how to use facets, and provides examples of common use 
cases.
