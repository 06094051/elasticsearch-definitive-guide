[[cluster-health]]
=== Cluster health

There are many statistics that can be monitored in an Elasticsearch cluster
but the single most important one is the _cluster health_, which reports a
`status` of either `green`, `yellow` or `red`:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_cluster/health
--------------------------------------------------

which, on an empty cluster with no indices, will return something like:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
   "cluster_name":          "elasticsearch",
   "status":                "green", <1>
   "timed_out":             false,
   "number_of_nodes":       1,
   "number_of_data_nodes":  1,
   "active_primary_shards": 0,
   "active_shards":         0,
   "relocating_shards":     0,
   "initializing_shards":   0,
   "unassigned_shards":     0
}
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `status` field is the one we're most interested in.

We will explain the meaning of each of these colors in the relevant section
below.
