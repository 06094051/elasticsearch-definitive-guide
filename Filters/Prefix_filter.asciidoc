[[prefix_filter]]
=== Prefix filter

The `prefix` filter asks the question: ``Does field `foo` contain any term
which begins with `prefix`?''

For instance, the example below will match documents whose `postcode`
field contains the terms `N1V` or `N1Y`, but will not match `N`, `N2`
or the lower case `n1`:

    { "prefix": { "postcode": "N1" }}

The prefix filter can be used only on fields of type `string`.


[CAUTION]
====
This filter works by loading all unique terms into memory,
finding those terms that begin with the desired prefix, then running a separate
<<term_filter,term filter>> on each of those terms. If the
specified field contains many unique terms, this can result in poor
performance or even consume all available memory!

While you can use the prefix filter on fields which contain a small number
of unique terms, the better solution is to prepare your data correctly so
that it is optimized for querying.
