=== Named filters

Sometimes it is useful to know which filters a document matched.  For instance,
you may want to include users of all ages, but know which age group each user
falls into. This can be done by assigning each filter a name, with the
`_name` parameter:


    {
        "or" : [
            { "range" : {
                  "_name" : "child",
                  "age"   : { "to" :  12 }
            }},
            { "range" : {
                  "_name" : "teenager",
                  "age"   : { "from" : 13, "to" :  18 }
            }},
            { "range" : {
                  "_name" : "adult",
                  "age"   : { "from" :  18 }
            }}
        ]
    }

Each result that matches a named filter will include a `matched_filters`
key with the names of the matching filters:

    {
        "_index" :           "myindex",
        "_type" :            "user",
        "_id" :              "1",
        "matched_filters" : ["teenager"],
        "_source" : {
            "age" :   15,
            ...
        }
    }

The only exception to this format is the `query` filter, which needs
the query to be wrapped in an extra `fquery` layer:

    {
        "query" : {
            "fquery" : {
                "query" :  { ... }
                "_name" :  "foo"
            }
        }
    }
