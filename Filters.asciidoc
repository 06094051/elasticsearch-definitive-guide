== Query DSL - Filters

Filters answer `yes|no` questions - documents either match a filter, or they
don't.  They are fast and efficient, and should be used instead of queries
whenever possible.

In the rest of this chapter, we will discuss the most commonly used
filter clauses. We start with filters because they are simpler than queries,
and more similar to the logic that we can express in SQL.
