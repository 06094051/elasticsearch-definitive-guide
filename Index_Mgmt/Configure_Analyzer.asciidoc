=== Configuring analyzers

The third important index setting is the `analysis` section, which is used
to configure existing analyzers or to create new custom analyzers
specific to your index.

In <<analysis-intro>> we introduced some of the built in analyzers,
which are used to convert full text strings into an inverted index,
suitable for searching.

The `standard` analyzer, which is the default analyzer
used for full text fields, is a good choice for most Western languages.
It consists of:

* the `standard` tokenizer, which splits the input text on word boundaries
* the `standard` token filter, which is intended to tidy up the the tokens
  emitted by the tokenizer, but currently is a no-op
* the `lowercase` token filter which converts all tokens into lowercase
* the `stop` token filter which removes English stopwords -- common words
  that have little impact on search relevance, such as `a`, `the`, `and`,
  `is` etc.

Of course, the `standard` analyzer can be used on text from languages
other than English, so the default choice of English stopwords may not be
appropriate.

In order to use the correct stopwords list for your documents, you
can customize the `standard` analyzer to create your own analyzer.
This new analyzer will be based on the `standard` analyzer,
but have a custom stopwords list. In the following example,
we create a new analyzer called the `es_std` analyzer, which
uses the predefined list of Spanish stopwords:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT /spanish_docs
{
    "settings": {
        "analysis": {
            "analyzer": {
                "es_std": {
                    "type":      "standard",
                    "stopwords": "_spanish_"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------


The `es_std` analyzer only exists in the `spanish_docs` index where we
have defined it.  It is not global.  To test it using the `analyze` API, we
must specify the index name:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST /spanish_docs/_analyze?analyzer=es_std
El veloz zorro marrón
--------------------------------------------------


The abbreviated results show that the Spanish stopword `"El"` has been
removed correctly:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "tokens" : [
    { "token" :    "veloz",   "position" : 2 },
    { "token" :    "zorro",   "position" : 3 },
    { "token" :    "marrón",  "position" : 4 }
  ]
}
--------------------------------------------------
