=== Dynamic mapping

As we discussed in <<mapping-intro>>, when Elasticsearch encounters a new
field in a document, it uses _dynamic mapping_ to determine the datatype for
the field and automatically adds the new field to the type mapping.

Sometimes this is the desired behaviour and sometimes it isn't. Perhaps
you don't know what fields will be added to your documents later on,
but you want them to be indexed automatically.  Perhaps you just want
to ignore them.  Or -- especially if you are using Elasticsearch as a
primary datastore -- perhaps you want unknown fields to throw an exception
to alert you to the problem.

Fortunately, you can control this behaviour with the `dynamic` setting,
which accepts the following options:

[horizontal]
`true`::    Add new fields dynamically -- the default
`false`::   Ignore new fields
`strict`::  Throw an exception if an unknown field is encountered

The `dynamic` setting may be applied to the root object or to any field
of type `object`.  You could set `dynamic` to `strict` by default,
but enable it just for a specific inner object:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
 PUT /my_index 
 {
     "mappings": {
         "my_type": {
             "dynamic":      "strict",
             "properties": {
                 "title":  { "type": "string"},
                 "stash":  {
                     "type":     "object",
                     "dynamic":  true
                 }
             }
         }
     }
 }
--------------------------------------------------

    
With this mapping, you can add new searchable fields into the `stash` object:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
 PUT /my_index/my_type/1 
 {
     "title":   "This doc adds a new field",
     "stash": { "new_field": "Success!" }
 }
--------------------------------------------------

    
But trying to do the same at the top level will fail:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
 PUT /my_index/my_type/1 
 {
     "title":     "This throws a StrictDynamicMappingException",
     "new_field": "Fail!"
 }
--------------------------------------------------

    
[NOTE]
====
Setting `dynamic` to `false` doesn't alter the contents of the
`_source` field at all -- the `_source` will still contain the whole
JSON document that you indexed.  However, any unknown fields will not be added
to the mapping and will not be searchable.
