=== Index Settings

There are many many knobs that you can twiddle to
customize index behaviour, which you can read about in the
http:/www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/index-modules/[Index Modules
reference documentation].

*But remember*: Elasticsearch comes with good defaults. Don't twiddle
these knobs until you really need to.

Two of the most important settings are:

`number_of_shards`::

    The number of primary shards that an index should have,
    which defaults to `5`.  This setting cannot be changed
    after index creation.

`number_of_replicas`::

    The number of replica shards (copies) that each primary shard
    should have, which defaults to `1`.  This setting can be changed
    at any time on a live index.

For instance, we could create a new small index with no replica shards
with the following request:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
 PUT /my_temp_index
 {
     "settings": {
         "number_of_shards" :   1,
         "number_of_replicas" : 0
     }
 }
--------------------------------------------------


We can change the number of replica shards later on, using the
`update-index-settings` API as follows:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
 PUT localhost/9200/my_temp_index/_settings
 {
     "number_of_replicas": 1
 }
--------------------------------------------------
