== Query DSL - Queries

While filters provide the same `yes|no` matching capabilities that you would
expect from SQL, queries are about relevance, about how well each document
matches. This concept of relevance is perfectly suited to the imprecise
nature of full text search.

That said, relevance is not just about full text search. It can equally be
applied to `yes|no` clauses where the more clauses that match, the more
relevant, or to geolocation queries, where closer is better.

Multiple query clauses can be combined using one of the
<<compound_queries,Compound queries>> such as `bool` or `dismax`.  Any of the
queries explained below can be used wherever in the API a parameter includes
the word `query`, such as the <<search_api,`search` API>>
or in a <<query_facet,`query` facet>>.
