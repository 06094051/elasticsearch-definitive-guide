=== Creating a new document

How can we be sure, when we index a document, that we are creating an
entirely new document and not overwriting an existing one?

Remember that the combination of `_index`, `_type` and `_id` uniquely
identifies a document.  So the easiest way to ensure that our document
is new is by letting Elasticsearch auto-generate a new unique `_id`,
using the `POST` version of the index request:

    curl -XPOST localhost:9200/website/blog/ -d '
    { ... }
    '

However, if we already have an `_id` that we want to use, then we have
to tell Elasticsearch that it should only accept our index request if
a document with the same `_index`, `_type` and `_id` doesn't exist already.
There are two ways of doing this, which amount to the same thing. Use
whichever method is more convenient for you.

The first method uses the `op_type` query string parameter:

    curl -XPUT localhost:9200/website/blog/123?op_type=create -d '
    { ... }
    '

And the second uses the `/_create` endpoint in the URL:

    curl -XPUT localhost:9200/website/blog/123/_create -d '
    { ... }
    '

If the request succeeds in creating a new document, then Elasticsearch will
return the usual metadata and an HTTP response code of `201 Created`.

If a document with the same `_index`, `_type` and `_id` already exists,
Elasticsearch will respond with a `409 Conflict` response code, and an
error message like the following:

    {
      "error" : "DocumentAlreadyExistsException[[website][4] [blog][123]:
                 document already exists]",
      "status" : 409
    }
