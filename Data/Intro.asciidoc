Elasticsearch is a distributed document store. It can
store and retrieve objects -- represented by JSON documents -- in real-time.
In other words, as soon as a document has been stored in Elasticsearch,
it can be retrieved by ID from any node in the cluster.

In this chapter we will discuss the APIs that we use to create, retrieve,
update and delete documents. For the moment, we don't care about
what is inside the document or how we can search for it. All we care about
is how to store our documents safely in Elasticsearch, and how to get
them back again.
