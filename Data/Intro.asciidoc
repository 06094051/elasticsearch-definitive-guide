Elasticsearch is a distributed document store. It can
store and retrieve objects represented by JSON documents in real-time.
In other words, as soon as a document has been stored in Elasticsearch,
it can be retrieved by ID from any node in the cluster.

In this chapter we will discuss the APIs that we use to create, retrieve,
update and delete documents. We will explain how Elasticsearch ensures
that your changes are persistent and available in real-time, not just
on a single node but across a multi-node cluster.

We will discuss how Elasticsearch uses optimistic version
control to ensure that changes are applied consistently, and finally
we will look at TODO DISCUSS ROUTING HERE OR LEAVE IT TO ITS OWN CHAPTER?
