=== Limiting Memory Usage

Because aggregations are the largest user of field data, and field data tends
to be the largest memory consumer in Elasticsearch, there are several mechanisms
to limit the amount of memory used by field data.

These hard and soft limits are important.  From a stability point of view, it is
important to never try and allocate more memory than is available since that could
cause an OutOfMemory exception.  From a performance point of view, it is important
to give enough memory to field data so that the data structure is fully loaded
and resident in memory.
