== Analyzing natural language

A word in English is relatively simple to spot: words are separated by
whitespace or punctuation, although there is still room for controversy: is
``you're'' one word or two? What about ``o'clock'', ``co-operate'',
``half-baked'' or ``eyewitness''?

Languages like German or Dutch combine individual words to create longer
compound words like ``Weißkopfseeadler'' (white head sea eagle), but in order
to be able to return ``Weißkopfseeadler'' as a result for the query ``Adler''
(eagle), we need to understand how to break up compound words into their
constituent parts.

Asian languages are even more complex, with
