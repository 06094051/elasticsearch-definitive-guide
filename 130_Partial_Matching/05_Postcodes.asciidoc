=== Postcodes and structured data

We will use UK postcodes to illustrate how to use partial matching with
structured data. UK postcodes have a well defined structure. For instance the
postcode `W1V 3DG` can be broken down into:

* `W1V` -- The outer part, identifies the postal area and district, consists of:

**  `W` --     Area, one or two letters
**  `1V` --    District, one or two numbers, possibly followed by a letter

* `3DG` -- The inner part, identifies a street or building, consists of:

** `3` --     Sector, one number
** `DG` --    Unit, two letters


Let's assume that we are indexing postcodes as exact value `not_analyzed`
fields, so we could create our index as follows:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT /myindex
{
    "mappings": {
        "address": {
            "properties": {
                "postcode": {
                    "type":  "string",
                    "index": "not_analyzed"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

And index some postcodes:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT /myindex/address/1
{ "postcode": "W1V 3DG" }

PUT /myindex/address/2
{ "postcode": "W2F 8HW" }

PUT /myindex/address/3
{ "postcode": "W1F 7HW" }

PUT /myindex/address/4
{ "postcode": "WC1N 1LZ" }

PUT /myindex/address/5
{ "postcode": "SW5 0BE" }
--------------------------------------------------

Now our data is ready to be queried.
