== Query DSL â€“ powerful search language

elasticsearch provides an expressive, powerful structured query language which 
allows us to tailor our searches to our exact requirements. This chapter 
explains each part of the query DSL and how to combine these individual 
parts to create complex but efficient queries. 

Some more complex parts of the Query DSL are dealt with in later chapters.
