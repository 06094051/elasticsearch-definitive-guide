=== What is Structured Search?

Structured search is all about interrogating data that has some type of inherent
structure.  Dates, times and numbers are all structured -- they have a precise 
format and you can perform logical operations on them.

 - _Is this date older than 30 days ago?_
 - _Show me all prices between 20 and 50_
 - _Return all documents with age > 25_

Text can be structured too.  A human is ``male'' or ``female''.  A blog post is 
tagged with keywords ``distributed'' and ``search''.

With structured search, the answer to your question is often a yes or no:
something either belongs to your query or it does not.  In many cases, 
structured search does not concern itself with relevance so much as including or
excluding.

****
You may notice some parallels to traditional, relational databases here.

RDBMs are typically very good at structured search.  `SELECT * FROM table WHERE 
date > 07/10/2013`.

RDBMs are good at these questions because they don't require relevance calculations.

But don't worry, Elasticsearch is very good at structured search too, and you'll
find that the flexible nature of the query DSL makes it easy to represent
advanced queries which would be very difficult in SQL.
