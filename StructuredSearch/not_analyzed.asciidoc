=== Use not_analyzed for structured search

In many structured search situations, it makes sense to map a field
as `not_analyzed`. With structured search, you only care about exact values.

The default behavior of Elasticsearch is to analyze your data so that you can
perform full-text seach as discussed in <<analysis-intro>>.  For structured
search, you want to disable this behavior by setting `index: not_analyzed` (see
<<_customizing_field_mappings>> for more details).

Once your fields are treated as `not_analyzed`, you can begin to use structured
search queries without running into strange analysis problems due to stemming, 
lowercasing, etc.
