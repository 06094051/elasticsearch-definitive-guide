==== Use not_analyzed for structured search

The default behavior of Elasticsearch is to analyze your data so that you can
perform full-text search as discussed in <<analysis-intro>>.  For structured
search, you will often want to disable this behavior by setting 
`index: not_analyzed` (see <<_customizing_field_mappings>> for more details).

The reason for this is fairly obvious: structured search is all about exact
values. The last thing we want is to transform our exact values through some 
type of analysis process.  We want the field to be entirely untouched, and thus
we usually make the fields `not_analyzed`.
