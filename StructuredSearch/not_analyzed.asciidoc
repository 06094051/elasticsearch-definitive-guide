==== Use not_analyzed for structured search

The default behavior of Elasticsearch is to analyze your data so that you can
perform full-text seach as discussed in <<analysis-intro>>.  For structured
search, you want to disable this behavior by setting `index: not_analyzed` (see
<<_customizing_field_mappings>> for more details).

The reason for this is fairly obvious: structured search is about exact values.
The last thing we want is to transform our exact values through some type
of analysis process.  We want the field to be entirely untouched.
