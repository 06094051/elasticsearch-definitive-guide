Since Elasticsearch allows you to dynamically add new fields, it is sometimes
difficult to know what fields any particular document may have.  Elasticsearch
has two filters which can help: Exists and Missing.

==== Exists Filter

The Exists filter will return documents that have values in the specified field.
For example, given these two documents:

    { "first_name" : "Zachary, "middle_name" : "Joseph }
    { "first_name" : "Noah }

An exists filter checking for "middle_name" will only return the first document,
since the second document does not have a "middle_name" field.

==== Missing Filter

The Missing filter is essentially the inverse of the Exists filter: it returns
documents where there is _no_ value for a particular field.  A Missing filter
on the documents above, only the second one ("Noah") will be returned.

Missing filter has a few additional options that Exists doesn't have. By default,
the filter only matches documents that are literally missing a field.  If the
field is present but `null`, it won't match the filter.

If you'd like to change this behavior, the `null_value` option can be set to
`true`. This makes Missing also match documents where the field is present,
but the value is a `null`.
