==== Filters are for structured search

Filters are the main tool used in structured search. Filters do not contribute 
to the scoring or sorting of the search results.  Because of this, they enjoy 
some considerable performance boosts over queries.

If you find yourself requiring a condition (_All documents must include the 
term `Arkansas'_), but that condition doesn't affect the score in any way...
use a filter.
