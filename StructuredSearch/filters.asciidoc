=== Filters

As mentioned before, structured search is usually concerned with yes/no questions.
Similarly, Filters in Elasticsearch are all about one thing: including/excluding documents.

Filters do not contribute to the scoring or sorting of the search results.  Because of this,
they enjoy some considerable performance boosts over queries.

If you find yourself requiring a condition (_All documents must include the term `Arkansas'_), but
that condition doesn't affect the score in any way...use a filter.

Taking it a step further, you can _usually_ construct all of your structured search with just filters.
Most queries have a filter equivalent (e.g. Term query and Term filter), so it should be very
easy to boost performance by replacing queries with filters.
