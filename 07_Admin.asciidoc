The majority of this book has been aimed at building applications using Elasticsearch
as the backend.  This section is a little different.  Here, you will learn
how to manage Elasticsearch itself.  Elasticsearch is a very complex piece of
software, with many moving parts.  There are a large number of APIs designed
to help you manage your Elasticsearch deployment.

In this chapter, we will cover three main topics:

- Monitoring your cluster's vital statistics, what behaviors are normal and which
should be cause for alarm, and how to interpret various stats provided by Elasticsearch
- Deploying your cluster to production, including best-practices and important
configuration which should (or should not!) be changed
- Post-deployment logistics, such as how to perform a rolling restart or backup
your cluster
