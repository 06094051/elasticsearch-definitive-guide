=== Analysis and analyzers

_Analysis_ is the process of first, tokenizing a block of text into
individual _terms_ suitable for use in an inverted index, then normalizing
these terms into a standard form to improve their ``searchability'' or
_recall_. This job is performed by _analyzers_.

An _analyzer_ is really just a wrapper which combines three functions
into a single package:

 * First, the string is passed through any _character filters_ in turn.
   Their job is to tidy up the string before tokenization. A
   character filter could be used to strip out HTML, or to convert
   `"&"` characters to the word `"and"`.

 * Next, the string is tokenized into individual terms by a _tokenizer_.
   A simple tokenizer might split the text up into terms whenever it
   encounters whitespace or punctuation.

 * Last, each term is passed through any _token filters_ in turn, which
   can change terms (eg lowercasing `"Quick"`), remove terms (eg
   stopwords like `"a"`, `"and"`, `"the"` etc)
   or add terms (eg synonyms like `"jump"` and `"leap"`)

Elasticsearch provides many character filters, tokenizers and token filters
out of the box. These can be combined to create custom analyzers suitable
for different purposes. We will discuss these in detail in <<analysis>>.

==== Built-in analyzers

However, Elasticsearch also ships with a number of pre-packaged analyzers that
you can use directly. We list the most important ones below and, to demonstrate
the difference in behaviour, we show what terms each would produce
from this string:

    "Set the shape to semi-transparent by calling set_trans(5)"

Standard analyzer::

The standard analyzer is the default analyzer that Elasticsearch uses.
It is the best general choice for analyzing text which may be
in any language. It splits the text on _word boundaries_, as defined
by the http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/[Unicode Consortium],
and removes most punctuation. By default, it removes English
_stopwords_ -- common words that don't have much impact on search such
as `"the"` or `"and"`. It would produce:

    set, shape, semi, transparent, calling, set_trans, 5

Simple analyzer::

The simple analyzer splits the text on anything that isn't a letter,
and lowercases the terms. It would produce:

    set, the, shape, to, semi, transparent, by, calling, set, trans

Whitespace analyzer::

The whitespace analyzer splits the text on whitespace. It doesn't
lowercase. It would produce:

    Set, the, shape, to, semi-transparent, by, calling, set_trans(5)

Language analyzers::

Language-specific analyzers are available for many languages. They
are able to take the peculiarities of the specified language into
account. For instance, the `english` analyzer comes with a set of
English stopwords, and is able to _stem_ English words because it
understands the rules of English grammar.
+
The `english` analyzer would produce the following:
+
    set, shape, semi, transpar, call, set_tran, 5
+
Note how `"transparent"` and `"calling"` have been stemmed to their root
form.

==== When analyzers are used

When we index a document, its full text fields are analyzed into terms,
which are used to create the index.  However, when we *search* on a full
text field,  we need to pass the query string through the
*same analysis process*, to ensure that we are searching for terms in the
same form as those in the index.

Full text queries, which we will discuss later, understand how each
field is defined, and so they can do the right thing:

 * When you query a full text field, the query will apply the same analyzer
   to the query string to produce the correct list of terms to search for.

 * When you query an exact field, the query will not analyze the
   query string, but instead search for the exact value that you have
   specified.

Now you can understand why the queries that we demonstrated in
<<data-type-differences>> return what they do:

The `date` field contains an exact value: the single term `"2013-09-15"`.
The `_all` field is a full text field, so the analysis process has
converted the date into the three terms: `"2013"`, `"09"` and `"15"`.

When we query the `_all` field for `2013`, it matches all 12 tweets,
because all of them contain the term `2013`:

    curl localhost:9200/_search?q=2013              # 12 results

When we query the `_all` field for `2013-09-15`, it first analyzes the
query string to produce a query which matches any of the terms `2013`, `09`
or `15`. This also matches all 12 tweets, because all of them contain
the term `2013`:

    curl localhost:9200/_search?q=2013-09-15        # 12 results !

When we query the `_date` field for `2013-09-15`, it looks for that
exact date, and finds one tweet only:

    curl localhost:9200/_search?q=date:2013-09-15   # 1  result

When we query the `_date` field for `2013`, it finds no documents
because none contain that exact date:

    curl localhost:9200/_search?q=date:2013         # 0  results !

==== Testing analyzers

You can use the `analyze` API to see how text is analyzed. Specify which
analyzer to use in the query string parameters, and the text to analyze
in the body:

    curl localhost:9200/_analyze?analyzer=standard -d '
    Text to analyze
    '

Each element in the result represents a single term:

    {
      "tokens" : [ {
        "token" :        "text",
        "position" :     1,
        "start_offset" : 1,
        "end_offset" :   5,
        "type" :         "<ALPHANUM>"
      }, {
        "token" :        "analyze",
        "position" :     3,
        "start_offset" : 9,
        "end_offset" :   16,
        "type" :         "<ALPHANUM>"
      } ]
    }

The `token` is the actual term that will be stored in the index. The
`position` indicates the order in which the terms appeared in the
original text -- note how the term `"analyze"` is in position 3
instead of 2.  This is because position 2 was occupied by the stopword
`"to"`, which has been removed.

The `start_offset` and `end_offset` indicate the character positions
that the original word occupied in the original string.

The `analyze` API is really useful tool for understanding what is happening
inside Elasticsearch indices, and we will talk more about it as
we progress.

==== Specifying analyzers

When Elasticsearch detects a new string field in your documents, it
automatically configures it as a full text field and analyzes it
with the `standard` analyzer.

You don't always want this. Perhaps you want to apply a different analyzer
which suits the language your data is in. And sometimes you want a
string field to be just a string field -- to index the exact value that
you pass in, without any analysis, such as a string user ID or an
internal status field or tag.

In order to achieve this, we have to configure these fields manually
by specifying the _mapping_.
