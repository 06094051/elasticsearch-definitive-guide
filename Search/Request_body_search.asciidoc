=== Full body search

Search _lite_ -- query string search --  is useful for ad hoc queries
from the command line. To harness the full power of search, however,
you should use the _request body_ `search` API, so called because most
parameters are passed in the JSON request body instead of the query string.

Request body search (henceforth known as just `search`) not only
handles the query itself, but also allows you to return highlighted
snippets from your results, aggregate analytics across all results
or subsets of results, and return _did-you-mean?_ suggestions,
which will help guide your users to the best results quickly.

==== Empty search

Let's start with the simplest form of the `search` API, the empty search,
which returns all documents in all indices.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_search {}
--------------------------------------------------

Just as for the query-string search, you can search on one, many or `_all`
indices, and one, many or all types:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /index_2013*/type1,type2/_search {}
--------------------------------------------------

And you can use the `from` and `size` parameters for pagination:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_search
{
    "from": 30,
    "size": 10
}
--------------------------------------------------


[NOTE]
====
Some languages, such as Javascript, don't allow request bodies with
a `GET` request. For this reason, the `search` API can also be used as a
`POST` request:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST /_search {}
--------------------------------------------------

Alternatively, you can use a `GET` request and pass the body in the query
string, as the `source` parameter:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_search?source=%7B%7D  # equivalent of {}
--------------------------------------------------


However, request bodies can be quite long and may exceed the maximum
query string length which can be as low as 2,000 bytes.
====

We will talk about highlighting, aggregations, and _did-you-mean?_ suggestions
in later chapters. For now, we're going to focus just on the query.
Instead of the cryptic query-string approach, request body search allows us
to write queries using the _Query Domain Specific Language_, or Query DSL.
