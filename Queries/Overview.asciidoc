.Query families
****
There are many different query clauses available in Elasticsearch. To make them
easier to navigate, we can group them into families:

<<helper-queries,Helper queries>>::

The helper queries are simple, commonly used queries, which are not terribly
interesting by themselves, but are very useful:

** <<match-all-query,`match_all`>>
** <<filtered-query,`filtered`>>

<<full-text-queries,Full text queries>>::

These queries have an _analysis phase_ which normalizes the ``full text''
query string into the same tokens or terms that are stored in the index.  They
are the bread-and-butter of full text search. However, they are not limited to
just full text -- they can also be used on numbers, dates, booleans and enum
strings:

** <<match-query,`match`>> | <<multi-match-query,`multi_match`>>
** <<query-string-query,`field` | `query_string`>>

<<term-queries,Term queries>>::

Term queries search for the exact term that is specified in the query
-- they have no analysis phase -- and are thus similar to the
<<term-filter,`term`>> and <<range-filter,`range`>> filters except
that they are not cached can be used to alter the relevance `_score`:

** `term` | `terms`
** `range`

<<partial-queries,Multi-term queries>>::

Like term queries, multi-term queries also search for exact values, and do not
have an analysis phase. However,  the list of exact values they search for
is built up by expanding the query term into a list of terms which could match:

** <<prefix-query,`prefix`>>
** <<wildcard-query,`wildcard`>>
** <<regexp-query,`regexp`>>
** <<fuzzy-query,`fuzzy`>>

Compound queries::

Compound queries allow us to join multiple queries together --
the difference between them is how the final relevance `_score` is calculated:

** <<bool-query,`bool`>>
** <<dismax-query,`dis_max`>>

Boosting queries::

Boosting queries, which are discussed in <<boost>> are all about manipulating
the relevance score:

** `constant_score`
** `custom_score`
** `custom_filters_score`
** `boosting`
** `custom_boost_factor`

Complex full text queries::

Complex full text queries combine a number of different full text and
multi-term query techniques to find the most relevant documents:

** `mlt` | `mlt_field`
** `flt` | `flt_field`

Relational queries::

Relational queries are used with _nested_ documents or with _parent-child_
relationships and are discussed in <<relations>>.

** `nested`
** `has_child`
** `has_parent`
** `top_children`

Span queries::

Span queries are a family of low level term queries which are useful for
searching for terms in a particular order or proximity:

** `span_term`
** `span_first`
** `span_near`
** `span_not`
** `span_or`
