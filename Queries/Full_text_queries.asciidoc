=== Full text queries

Up until now, we have dealt only with matching exact values.
The _full text query_ family performs the semi-magical job of finding the
documents that best match a natural language query string.

But of course, it isn't magic -- internally, a full text query runs
a number of *exact match* (or _term_) queries and combines their results to
provide the final answer. But, an exact search for the term `dogs` won't
match the term `dog`, and `CAT` won't match `cat`.

The key to full text search is to ensure that _we search for exactly the same
terms as are stored in our index_.  In other words, both the full
text data in our documents and the full text query string need to be normalized.

This process is called _Analysis_ and will be discussed fully in <<analysis>>.
For now it is enough to know that:

 * By default, string fields are _analyzed_ before being indexed, so
   a field with the phrase `"The Quick Brown Fox"`
   would be indexed as the terms:

   ["quick", "brown", "fox"]

 * Full text query strings are analyzed before searching, so
   the query string `"A QUICK FOX!"` would become a search for the
   terms:

   ["quick", "fox"]

Because both the indexed data and the search terms have been normalized into
the same form, it is now easy to find documents in our index that match
our search terms.

.`analyzed` vs `not_analyzed` text fields
****
String fields can contain either:

*  _full text_, (like the body of an email)
which requires analysis in order to be searchable, or

* _exact values_
(like enums, post codes, product numbers, or tags) which are *not* analyzed
but are indexed exactly as they are.

By default, Elasticsearch assumes that all string fields contain
full text. They are defined (or ``mapped'') as:

    { "type": "string", "index": "analyzed" }

String fields which contain exact values have to be manually defined as:

    { "type": "string", "index": "not_analyzed" }

We will explain how to setup `not_analyzed` fields in <<mapping>>, but for
now, it is important to know the distinction between the two.
****

All of the queries in the full text family have an analysis phase. However,
they are not limited to searching only full text.  They can also be used
for fields that contain numbers or dates, or strings which are not analyzed,
such as tags or zip codes. Full text queries do ``the right thing'' based upon
the field definition, or _mapping_, which will be explained in <<mapping>>.
