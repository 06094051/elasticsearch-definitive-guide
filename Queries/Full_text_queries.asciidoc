=== Full text queries

Up until now, we have dealt only with matching exact values.
The _full text query_ family performs the semi-magical job of finding the
documents that best match an unstructured natural language query string.

But of course, it isn't magic -- internally, a full text query runs
a number of *exact match* (or _term_) queries and combines their results to
provide the final answer. But, an exact search for the term `dogs` won't
match the term `dog`, and `CAT` won't match `cat`.

The key to full text search is to ensure that _we search for exactly the same
terms as would be stored in our index_.  In other words, both the full
text data in the index and the full text query string need to be normalized.

This process is called _Analysis_ and will be discussed fully in <<analysis>>.
For now it is enough to know that, by default, all string fields are analyzed
before being indexed, and that full text query strings undergo the same
analysis process.

For example, at index time a field with the phrase `"The Quick Brown Fox"`
would be indexed as the terms `["quick", "brown", "fox"]`, while at search time
the query string `"A QUICK FOX!"` would become a search for the
terms `["quick", "fox"]`.

All of the queries in the full text family have an analysis phase. However,
they are not limited to searching only full text.  They can also be used
for fields that contain numbers or dates, or strings which are not analyzed,
such as tags or zip codes. These queries do ``the right thing'' based upon
the field definition, or _mapping_, which will be explained in <<mapping>>.

.`analyzed` vs `not_analyzed` text fields
****
String fields can either contain _full text_, (like the body of an email)
which requires analysis in order to be searchable, or _exact values_
(like enums, post codes, product numbers, or tags) which are not analyzed
before being indexed.

By default, elasticsearch assumes that all string fields contain
full text. They are defined (or ``mapped'') as:

    { "type": "string", "index": "analyzed" }

String fields which contain exact values have to be manually defined as:

    { "type": "string", "index": "not_analyzed" }

We will explain how to setup `not_analyzed` fields in <<mapping>>, but for
now, it is important to know the distinction between the two.
