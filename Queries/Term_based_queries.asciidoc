.Term-based queries
[[term_queries]]
****
Term based queries are distinct from full text queries like the
<<match_query,`match`>> and <<query_string_query,`query_string`>> queries.

Full text queries::

    consider the _mapping_ or field definition for the field(s) being queried,
    and apply the appropriate _analysis_ to the query string. In other words,
    they convert the full text query string into a list of _terms_ or tokens
    in a canonical format,
    then search the index for those exact terms -- a query string of
    `"Foo Bar"` might result in queries for the two terms
    `"foo"` and `"bar"`.

Term-based queries::

    have no analysis phase.  A term query for `"Foo"` will search
    for that *exact term* -- it won't match the indexed term `"foo"`.

As explained in <<exact_queries>>, we would normally use a `match` query
for exact matching, as it can use the field mapping to decide whether the field
contains full text or exact values and query it appropriately . While the
`term` query exists, the only time we would need to use it is when we want to
do an exact term match on a field that contains analyzed full text.

The term-based queries are:
http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/term-query.html[`term`],
http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/terms-query.html[`terms`],
http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/range-query.html[`range`],
http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/prefix-query.html[`prefix`],
http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/wildcard-query.html[`wildcard`]
and the
http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/span-term-query.html[`span`]-family
of queries. None of these queries has an analysis phase
-- they expect their search term to be in the same format as the terms
in the index.
