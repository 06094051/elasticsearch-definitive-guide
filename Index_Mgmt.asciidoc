== Index Management

We have seen how Elasticsearch makes it easy to start developing a new
application without requiring any advance planning.  However, it doesn't take
long before we need to fine-tune the indexing and search process
to better suit our particular use case.

Almost all of these customizations happen in the _index_, and in the _types_
which it contains.  In this chapter we will discuss the APIs
for managing indices and type _mappings_, and the most important settings.
