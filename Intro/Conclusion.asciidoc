=== Conclusion

By now you should have a taste of the things that you can do with
Elasticsearch, and how easy it makes it to get started.

The authors of Elasticsearch have worked hard to make it easy to
become productive with the minimum of preparation and knowledge.

However, the more you know about Elasticsearch, the more productive you
can become.  The more you can tell Elasticsearch about the domain-specific
elements of your application, the more you can fine tune the output.

The rest of this book will help you move from novice to expert.
Each chapter will explain the essentials, but will also include
expert-level tips.  If you're just getting started, these tips are probably
not relevant to you.  Elasticsearch has intelligent defaults and will
generally do the right thing without any interference.  Later, when you
are looking to improve performance by shaving off any wasted milliseconds,
you can always revisit these chapters.
