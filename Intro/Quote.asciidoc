So we build a web site or an application and want to add search to it,
and then it hits us: *getting search working is hard*. We want our
search solution to be *fast*, we want a painless setup and a completely
*free search schema*, we want to be able to index data simply using
*JSON over HTTP*, we want our search server to be *always available*, we
want to be able to start with one machine and *scale to hundreds*, we want
*real-time search*, we want simple *multi-tenancy*, and we want a solution
that is *built for the cloud*.

*"This should be easier"*, we declared, *"and cool, bonsai cool"*.

Elasticsearch aims to solve all these problems and more.
It is an Open Source (Apache 2), Distributed, RESTful, Search Engine built on
top of Apache Lucene.

That's a lot of promises in a small amount of text. In this chapter,
we're going to give you a taste of what Elasticsearch can do for you, and to
explain a bit more about what these promises mean.
