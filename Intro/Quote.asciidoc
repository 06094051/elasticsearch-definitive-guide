So we build a web site or an application and want to add search to it,
and then it hits us: *getting search working is hard*.

We want our search solution to be *fast*, we want a painless setup and a
completely *free search schema*, we want to be able to index data simply using
*JSON over HTTP*, we want our search server to be *always available*, we want
to be able to start with one machine and *scale to hundreds*, we want *real-
time search*, we want simple *multi-tenancy*, and we want a solution that is
*built for the cloud*.

*"This should be easier"*, we declared, *"and cool. Bonsai cool!"*.

Elasticsearch aims to solve all these problems and more.
It is an Open Source (Apache 2), Distributed, RESTful, Search Engine built on
top of Apache Lucene.
