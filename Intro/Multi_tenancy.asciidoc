=== Multi-tenancy

Did you notice that we have indexed documents into two different indices:
`blogs` and `blogs2`?

Elasticsearch supports _multi-tenancy_. In other words, just like a
relational database can have multiple independent ``databases'',
Elasticsearch can have multiple independent indices. We can run
multiple applications off a single Elasticsearch cluster.

Also, just like a database can contain multiple tables, each index can have
multiple types, each with its own mapping or schema.

Unlike a relational database, Elasticsearch can search across
multiple types, and across multiple indices. Try this query:

    curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/blogs,blogs2/_search?pretty'

Later, you will see how the ability to search across multiple indices as if
they were one, allows us to scale out as our requirements grow.
