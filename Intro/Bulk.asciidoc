=== Bulk operations

For extra speed, if you can group document changes (create, update
or delete) then you can use the _bulk_ APIs to process several operations
in a single request.

In this request, we index two new documents into the `blogs2` index:

    curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_bulk?pretty'  -d '
    {"index" :     {"_index" : "blogs2", "_type" : "user", "_id": 1}}
    {"interests" : ["whales", "golf"], "fullname" : "Mary Jones"}
    {"index" :     {"_index" : "blogs2", "_type" : "user", "_id": 2}}
    {"interests" : ["golf", "wine", "cinema"], "fullname" : "Jack Jones"}
    '

Combining multiple operations into one reduces the amount of information that
we have to send over the network, which can give a big performance boost.
This is ideal for write-heavy applications, like storing log data in
Elasticsearch.

Similarly, you can retrieve multiple documents at once with the _multi-GET_
API:

    curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/blogs2/user/_mget?pretty'  -d '
    {
       "docs" : [
          { "_id" : 1 },
          { "_id" : 2 },
          { "_index": "blogs", "_id": "johnsmith" }
       ]
    }
    '
