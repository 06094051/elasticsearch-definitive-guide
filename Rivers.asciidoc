== Rivers - pulling instead of pushing

Normally an application pushes data to elasticsearch. Sometimes, it makes
more sense for elasticsearch to pull the data from the application or from
another data store. This service is called a river. elasticsearch comes
with officially supported rivers for CouchDB, Twitter and RabbitMQ. Various
other rivers are available as plugins.
