Proximity search, also known as phrase matching, is an important part of many
search applications.  Phrase matching helps ensure search results are relevant,
since phrases are both rarer than terms and also carry additional context.

"Sue ate alligator" and "alligator ate Sue" are very different sentences
(especially if you are Sue!), but searching for ["ate" AND "aligator"] will return
both.

When Elasticsearch analyzes your text into tokens, it stores the positions of
each token. A search for "ate alligator" as a phrase implies that "ate" comes
before "alligator" in the position list, and thus excludes documents where
that condition is not true.
