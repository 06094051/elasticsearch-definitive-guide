=== Tutorial Conclusion

Hopefully this little tutorial was a good demonstration about what is possible
in Elasticsearch.  It is really just scratching the surface and many features
 -- such as suggestions, geo, percolator, fuzzy and partial matches -- were 
omitted to keep the tutorial short.  But it did highlight just how easy it is
to start building advanced search functionality.  No configuration was needed...
just add data and start searching!

It's likely the syntax left you confused in places, and you may have questions
about how to tweak and tune various aspects.  That's fine!  The rest of the book
will dive into each of these issues and you will have a much better 
grasp of how Elasticsearch works.
