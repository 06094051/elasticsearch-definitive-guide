Elasticsearch is a real-time distributed search and analytics engine which
allows you to explore your data at a speed and at a scale never before
possible.

It is used for full text search, structured search, analytics, and
all three in combination.  It can run on your laptop, or scale out to hundreds
of servers and petabytes of data.

No individual part of Elasticsearch is new or revolutionary. The revolution is
the combination of these individual gems into a single coherent application
that has a low barrier to entry for the new user, but which can grow with your
needs.

If you are picking up this book, it is because you have data.  And there is no
point in having data unless you plan to *do something* with it.

Unfortunately, most databases are astonishingly inept at extracting actionable
knowledge from your data. Sure, they can filter by timestamp or exact values,
but can they perform full-text search, handle synonyms and score documents by
relevance?  Can they generate analytics and aggregations from the same data?
Most importantly, can they do this in real-time without big batch processing
jobs?

This is what sets Elasticsearch apart; Elasticsearch encourages you to explore
and utilize your data, rather than letting it rot in a warehouse because it is
too difficult to query.

Elasticsearch is your new best friend.
