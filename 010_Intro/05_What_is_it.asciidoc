=== What is Elasticsearch?

Elasticsearch is a search engine built on top of
https://lucene.apache.org/core/[Apache Lucene(TM)] , a full-text search engine
library.  Lucene is arguably the most advanced, performant and fully-featured
search engine library in existence today -- both open source and proprietary.

But Lucene is just a library. To leverage its power you need to work in Java
and to integrate Lucene directly with your application. Worse, you will likely
require a degree in Information Retrieval to understand how it works.  Lucene
is *very* complex.

Elasticsearch uses Lucene internally for all of its indexing and search, but
it aims to make full text search easy by hiding the complexities of Lucene
behind a simple, coherent API.

However, Elasticsearch is much more than just Lucene and much more than
``just'' full text search. It is also:

* a distributed document store where *every field* is indexed and
   searchable
* a distributed search engine with real-time analytics
* capable of scaling to hundreds of servers and petabytes of structured
  and unstructured data.

And it packages up all of this functionality into a standalone server
that your application can talk to via a simple RESTful API, using
a web client from your favorite programming language, or even
from the command line.

It is easy to get started with Elasticsearch. It ships with sensible defaults
and hides complicated search theory away from beginners. It _just works_,
right out of the box. With minimal understanding, you can soon become
productive.

As your knowledge grows, you can leverage more of Elasticsearch's
advanced features. The entire engine is configurable and very flexible.
Pick and choose from the advanced features to tailor Elasticsearch to your
problem domain.
