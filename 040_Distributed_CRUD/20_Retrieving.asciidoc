=== Retrieving a document

A document can be retrieved from a primary shard or from any of its replicas.
The request process is depicted in <<img-distrib-read>>.

1. The client sends a get request to `Node 1`.

2. The node uses the document's `_id` to determine that the document
   belongs to shard `0`. Copies of shard `0` exist on all three nodes.
   On this occasion, it forwards the request to `Node 2`, which returns
   the document.

For read requests, the requesting node will choose a different shard copy on
every request -- it round-robins through the nodes.

It is possible that a document has been indexed on the primary shard but
has not yet been copied to the replica shards. In this case a replica
might report that the document doesn't exist, while the primary would have
returned the document successfully.
